 <h3>Pressure</h3>
 <br>
 <div class="text">
  <p>
   Weather pressure, or atmospheric pressure, is the force exerted by the Earth's atmosphere on a specific area. It
   plays
   a crucial role in understanding weather patterns and forecasting. Pressure is measured using instruments
  </p>
  <p>
   like
   barometers and is typically expressed in units of millibars (mb) or inches of mercury (inHg). Pressure gradients,
   created by differences in pressure, drive the movement of air masses. Changes in pressure can affect human comfort.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rapid pressure changes, often associated with
   approaching
   weather systems, can cause discomfort, particularly for individuals sensitive to such changes. Barometric pressure
   fluctuations can also impact plants and animals.
