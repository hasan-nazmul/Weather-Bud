 <h3>Wind Speed</h3>
 <br>
 <div class="text">
  <p>The wind whispers through the trees, carrying its gentle or forceful touch. It dances with leaves, rustles through
   grass, and paints patterns in the clouds. It is nature's invisible artist, shaping the world around us.
  </p>
  <p>
   The wind's embrace varies, from a soft caress that tickles the skin to a fierce gust that challenges our steps. It
   carries scents of distant lands and whispers tales of distant shores. Its speed, a testament to its power and
   influence
   on our surroundings.

  </p>
  <p>
   The wind dances through the trees, painting patterns in the air. It whispers secrets in hushed tones and sweeps away
   our
   worries. With each gust, it reminds us of the ever-changing nature of life and the freedom that comes from embracing
   the
   unknown.
